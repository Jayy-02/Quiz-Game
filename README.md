This quiz game was written in React using Vite for building.

All questions are loaded dynamically and shuffled from The Trivia API 

To use the API, click here
https://the-trivia-api.com/v2/questions/https://the-trivia-api.com/

API automatically selects an array of 10 questions, which are displayed one at a time.

On selecting an option, the option turns green if the correct answer is selected, otherwise, it turns red

The Restart button at the top right corner of the page allows you to load the same array of questions in the same order, if you wish to try them again.

At the end of the quiz, your score is displayed, alongside a "Play Again" button which loads a new array of questions when clicked.

The game is deployed using Render at https://quiz-game-h2vy.onrender.com/
